### Step 1: Create a repository on GitHub
1. Go to [GitHub.com](https://github.com/).
2. Log in to your account.
3. Click on the **"+"** sign at the top right â†’ **"New repository"**.
4. Fill in:
   - **Repository name**: (e.g., `my-project`)
   - **Description**: (optional)
   - **Public** or **Private** (your choice)
   - **Do NOT** initialize with README (uncheck if checked).
5. Click **Create repository**.

### Step 2: Open your terminal/command prompt
(Go to the project folder on your computer.)

```bash
cd path/to/your/project
```
(Replace `path/to/your/project` with your actual folder path.)

---
  
### Step 3: Initialize Git in your project folder

```bash
git init
```

This will make the folder a Git repository.

---

### Step 4: Add your files

```bash
git add .
```

This stages **all** your project files for the first commit.

---

### Step 5: Commit your changes

```bash
git commit -m "Initial commit"
```

You can change the message inside quotes if you want.

---

### Step 6: Link your local folder to GitHub repository

You need to copy the "URL" of your GitHub repo (the one GitHub showed you after creating).

Example if you chose HTTPS:
```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
```
(Replace with your actual GitHub username and repo name.)

---

### Step 7: Push to GitHub

```bash
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

(First command makes sure your branch is called `main`, matching GitHub.)

---

### Done! ðŸŽ‰
Your project should now appear on GitHub.

---

**Quick Summary:**
```bash
cd path/to/project
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
